#### ipinfo.sh

The `ipinfo.sh` script is a command-line tool that allows you to obtain detailed information about an IP address. By providing an IP address as an argument, the script queries the `ipinfo.io` website to retrieve and display data such as city, region, country, geographic coordinates, and associated organization.

### To use the script, simply run it with the desired IP address as an argument:

```bash
> ./ipinfo.sh 8.8.8.8
```
